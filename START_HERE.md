## 🎓 What You'll Learn

✅ **Docker** - Containerization  
✅ **AWS ECS** - Container orchestration  
✅ **AWS Infrastructure** - VPC, ALB, IAM  
✅ **CI/CD** - Jenkins automation  
✅ **DevOps** - Blue-green deployment  
✅ **Best Practices** - Infrastructure as Code  

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Blue**: Current production (v1.0)
- **Green**: New version (v1.1)
- **Switch**: Instant traffic routing
- **Rollback**: Instant revert if issues

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ Zero downtime
- ✅ Easy rollback
- ✅ Full testing before production
- ✅ Reduced risk
- ✅ Perfect for demonstrations

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

1. **Check CloudWatch logs**
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /ecs/algorithm-visualizer --follow
   ```

2. **Check service status**
   ```bash
   aws ecs describe-services --cluster visualizer-cluster --services algorithm-visualizer-blue
   ```

3. **Review troubleshooting section** in README_ECS_DEPLOYMENT.md

4. **Re-read relevant documentation** - It's all there!

---

## 📞 Quick Commands

```bash
# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/algorithm-visualizer --follow

# Check service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster visualizer-cluster --services algorithm-visualizer-blue

# Get ALB DNS
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --names visualizer-alb --query 'LoadBalancers[0].DNSName'

# Stop services (save money!)
aws ecs update-service --cluster visualizer-cluster --service algorithm-visualizer-blue --desired-count 0
```
